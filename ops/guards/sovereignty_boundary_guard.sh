# sovereignty_boundary_guard.sh — TRL10 enforceable control for the KTOS sovereignty boundary (guard G-1).
# Ported from Adinkhepra-ASAF@28b332f scripts/sovereignty_boundary_guard.sh; runs identically there.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   AdinKhepra ASAF's core value prop and CMMC/DFARS posture depend on ONE invariant:
#   a customer's CUI compliance data plane (the Hub at :8443, Fleet, DAG, scan findings)
#   NEVER lands on a NouchiX-operated vendor host. Sovereignty must be *enforced*, not
#   *asserted in a comment*. This guard makes a violation fail loudly in CI.
#
#   Canonical policy: MEMORY.md § "Sovereignty Boundary Policy (TRL10 control)".
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS (deny-by-default on the data plane)
#   1. No shipped CLIENT (asaf-desktop, khepra-reporter, Hub/Backend client) may DEFAULT
#      its Hub / upstream / fleet API base URL to a vendor domain. Customer Hub URL is
#      per-tenant and supplied at runtime — never a compiled-in vendor subdomain.
#   2. No compose/env may bind a HUB / FLEET / CUI data-plane service to a vendor host.
#   3. Any public demo/eval scan surface on a vendor host (mcp./gateway.) MUST be
#      explicitly acknowledged in scripts/sovereignty_allowlist.txt with a data
#      classification of DEMO/SYNTHETIC — so "public scan endpoint" is a deliberate,
#      reviewed decision, not an accident.
#
# CONTROL vs DATA plane:
#   ALLOWED on vendor hosts  (control plane): telemetry.*, licensing/heartbeat, docs,
#                                             installer/artifact mirror, Stripe webhook,
#                                             and DEMO/discovery MCP (allowlisted).
#   FORBIDDEN on vendor hosts (data plane):   Hub :8443, Fleet API, customer DAG store,
#                                             customer scan findings, credential vault.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = boundary intact, 1 = violation(s) found, 2 = guard misconfig.
